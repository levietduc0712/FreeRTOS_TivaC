/******************************************************************************
 *
 * This project demonstrates how to configure the TM4C123GH6PM to blink a LED
 * using FreeRTOS queue.  Two tasks and one queue are created for this example.
 * The sending task sends a parameter at an interval of 1000ms to the queue.
 * The receiving task is in blocked state until  something is received in the
 * queue.  Upon receiving a correct parameter from the queue it sets the LED
 * for 500ms and then clears the LED for another 500ms.
 *
 * When either user switch SW1 or SW2 on the EK-TM4C123GXL is pressed, an
 * interrupt is generated to change the blink rate.  The amount of increase
 * or decrease is controlled by the #define BLINK_RATE.  SW1 is pressed to
 * speed up the blink rate while SW2 is pressed to slow down the blink rate.
 *
 * vBlinkyTask() creates one queue, and two tasks.  It then starts the
 * scheduler.
 *
 * The Queue Send Task:
 * The queue send task is implemented by the prvQueueSendTask() function in
 * this file.  prvQueueSendTask() sits in a loop that causes it to repeatedly
 * block for 1000 milliseconds, before sending the value 100 to the queue that
 * was created within vBlinkyTask().  Once the value is sent, the task loops
 * back around to block for another 1000 milliseconds.
 *
 * The Queue Receive Task:
 * The queue receive task is implemented by the prvQueueReceiveTask() function
 * in this file.  prvQueueReceiveTask() sits in a loop where it repeatedly
 * blocks on attempts to read data from the queue that was created within
 * vBlinkyTask().  When data is received, the task checks the value of the
 * data, and if the value equals the expected 100, sets the LED.  The 'block
 * time' parameter passed to the queue receive function specifies that the
 * task should be held in the Blocked state indefinitely to wait for data to
 * be available on the queue.  The queue receive task will only leave the
 * Blocked state when the queue send task writes to the queue.  As the queue
 * send task writes to the queue every 1000 milliseconds, the queue receive
 * task leaves the Blocked state every 1000 milliseconds.  Once unblocked,
 * the LED is first set for 500ms and then clear for 500ms.
